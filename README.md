# Console-Apps

These programs are designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts using the C# programming language. These concepts include data types, control structures, simple data structures, error-handling, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, and modular programming.

The goals of this project are to:

1. Demonstrate understanding of the program development life cycle.
2. Design, implement, compile, debug, test, and document programs in C#.
3. Use operators and assignments in program design.
4. Use primitive data types in program design.
5. Implement sequence, selection, and repetition structures in programs.
6. Use array data structures in program design.
7. Implement effective error and exception handling in programs.
8. Use user-defined methods and modular programming in program design.
9. Implement file processing in programs.
10. Design event-driven programs with a graphical user interface (GUI).
11. Use object-oriented programming features in program design.
12. Evaluate and critique the effectiveness and efficiency of code.
